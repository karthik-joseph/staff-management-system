## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Models Implementation

The Django ORM models are defined with appropriate fields and relationships:

```python
class Department(models.Model):
    dept_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Role(models.Model):
    role_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Employee(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=15)
    salary = models.IntegerField()
    bonus = models.IntegerField()
    dept = models.ForeignKey(Department)
    role = models.ForeignKey(Role)
    date_hire = models.DateTimeField()
```

### 4.2 Views Implementation

The system uses function-based views for handling HTTP requests:

#### 4.2.1 View Employee

```python
def view_employee(request):
    """
    View function to display all employees.
    Ensures fresh data is fetched from the database on each request.
    """
    employees = Employee.objects.all()

    context = {
        'employees': employees,
        'departments': Department.objects.all(),
        'roles': Role.objects.all(),
        'timestamp': datetime.datetime.now().timestamp(),
    }

    response = render(request, 'view_employees.html', context)
    return response
```

#### 4.2.2 Add Employee

```python
def add_employee(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        try:
            employee = Employee()
            # Set employee attributes from request.POST
            employee.save()
            return JsonResponse({
                'success': True,
                'message': 'Employee added successfully!',
                'employee': {
                    # Employee data
                }
            })
        except Exception as e:
            return JsonResponse({
                'success': False,
                'message': str(e)
            })
    return JsonResponse({
        'success': False,
        'message': 'Invalid request method'
    })
```

#### 4.2.3 Update and Delete Employees

Similar implementation for update_employee and delete_employee with appropriate error handling and success responses.

### 4.3 Frontend Implementation

#### 4.3.1 CSS Styling

The system uses a custom CSS file (index-new.css) with a modern color palette and responsive design:

```css
:root {
  --Soft-Shell: #fff2f2;
  --Lavender-Mist: #a9b5df;
  --Periwinkle: #7886c7;
  --Midnight-Navy: #2d336b;
  --primary-text: #333333;
  --alt-bg: #f8f8f8;
  --success: #2e7d32;
  --alert: #ff5a5a;
  --Warning: #ffbf00;
  --disabled: #6b7280;
  --font-family: "Inter", sans-serif;
  --border-radius: 8px;
  --box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  --transition-speed: 0.3s ease;
}
```

#### 4.3.2 AJAX Implementation

The system leverages AJAX for asynchronous operations to enhance user experience without page reloads.

## 5. Security Analysis

### 5.1 Implemented Security Measures

The current implementation includes several security features:

- **CSRF Protection**: Django's built-in Cross-Site Request Forgery protection
- **Input Validation**: Form validation to prevent malicious inputs
